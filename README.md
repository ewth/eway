# eWay

When exploring eWay's [Rapid API](https://www.eway.com.au/api-v3/), I found some of its functionality to be not
particularly well documented or accessible.

Using their PHP SDK is great, but still there seemed to be some aspects missing.

This repository is me toying around with the API and SDK more than a genuine attempt at producing any original
functionality, but I figured it can go on Github in case somebody finds it useful.
